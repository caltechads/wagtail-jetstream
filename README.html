<p>This is a collection of useful blocks and layouts for use within Wagtail&#8217;s StreamField construct.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>

<p><strong>DEBUG</strong> For now just install from the git repository and then add <code>jetstream</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPLICATIONS</code> in Django settings.</p>

<p>As of version 1.4, we no longer pre-compile the scss to css. Users are expected to run some sort of automatic sass compiler, like django-sass-processor, in order to compile the scss files.</p>

<h2 id="columnlayouts">Column Layouts</h2>

<p>Use of the column layouts requires some boilerplate from the developer because Wagtail currently does not have a mechanism for determining a block&#8217;s contents dynamically at runtime.</p>

<p>In the block declarations, subclass the desired block types as in the following example, adding to the column fields whichever blocks are desired to be added to the column&#8217;s internal StreamField.</p>

<pre><code>class TwoColumnBlock(BaseTwoColumnBlock):
    left_column = blocks.StreamBlock(
        COLUMN_PERMITTED_BLOCKS + [
            get_block_tuple(MyBlockType),
            ...
        ],
        icon='arrow-left',
        label='Left column content'
    )

    right_column = blocks.StreamBlock(
        COLUMN_PERMITTED_BLOCKS + [
            get_block_tuple(MyBlockType),
            ...
        ],
        icon='arrow-right',
        label='Right column content'
    )

</code></pre>

<h2 id="blocktypes">Block Types</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Some classes require custom javascript, so it is important to include <code>&lt;script defer src=&quot;{% static 'jetstream/js/layouts.js' %}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> somewhere on your page template.</p>

<p>Several image-related blocks, e.g. HeroImageCarouselBlock, use Bootstrap.js to implement their slideshow functionality. You&#8217;ll need to install and load Bootstrap 4.1+ for that those to function.</p>

<p>We also assume that you are using jQuery 3.x and Moderizr.</p>

<p><strong>TODO</strong></p>

<h1 id="helpers">Helpers</h1>

<h3 id="get_block_tuple">get_block_tuple()</h3>

<p>Returns a standardized tuple of the block&#8217;s class name and one of it&#8217;s instances for use within the declarations of a StreamField&#8217;s elements. This is useful when writing data migrations for the block because it allows the <code>type</code> field for each block to be standardized.</p>

<h3 id="blocktuplemixin">BlockTupleMixin</h3>

<p>A mixin class that, when included, allows the block to override the return of <code>get_block_tuple</code> for itself, allowing for customization of the block&#8217;s listing type.</p>
